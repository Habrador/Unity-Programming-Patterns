# 10. Bytecode

What if other people want to help you with your game, but these people have no coding skillz. A solution is to invent a simpler programming language everyone can learn, and then you integrate it with your game. 

**How to implement?**

The programmers with no skillz write their code in a .txt-file. You read that file, loop through each row, and then use a switch statement to translate the code from your programming language to C#.

**When is it useful?**

- If you want to add modding support.

- If you don't want to hard-code behaviour.
