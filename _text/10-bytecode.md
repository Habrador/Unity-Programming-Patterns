# 10. Bytecode

What if other people want to help you with your game, but these people have no coding skillz. A solution is to invent a simpler programming language everyone can learn, and then you integrate it with your game. 

**How to implement?**

The programmers with no skillz write their code in a .txt-file. You read that file, loop through each row, and then use a switch statement to translate the code from your programming language to C#.

**When is it useful?**

- To add modding support.

- To avoid hard-coded behaviour.

- To handle cutscenes and dialogue systems. Scripted sequences or dialogue interactions can be expressed in bytecode, allowing for easier management and execution of these sequences during gameplay.

- To manage and execute the conditions and actions required to unlock achievements or track player progress.
